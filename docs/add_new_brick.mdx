## How to add a new app template to the NEON CLI

You want to develop a new template app for the NEON CLI? Then this is the right spot. Basically, you're going to work with mason bricks and code generation. No clue what I am talking about? Then I recommend you to check out [mason for dummies][mason_link].

### Develop the template

That's the (rather) easy part. You develop a Flutter app as you normally would, that represents the template app you'd like to add to the CLI. Done? Let's continue then:

### Create the brick

It is now time to translate your template into a mason brick in order to fully leverage the power of code generation. You have no idea how to do this? [Here's][mason_link] a lot of ressources! You can go as crazy as you want whilst developing the brick:

- It's just a simple brick without any variables or other fancy stuff? Fine!
- You used a couple hundred brick variables and added pre- and post-gen-hooks? No problem!

### Test the brick

Compile your brick locally with `mason get` (you'll probably have to run `mason init` in your current directory before that). Now execute your brick with `mason make name_of_your_brick`. Works as expected? Then you may push your code to the `main` branch of the [NEON app library repo][app_library_repo_link]!

### Integrate the new brick into the CLI

Now things get real: you're going to update the NEON CLI! Clone the [CLI repo][cli_link] and checkout a new branch!
Then you'll have to open the file `lib/src/commands/abfahrt/options/app_options.dart` and add a new value to the enum `AppTemplates` that describes your new template.
The compiler will probably complain about some incomplete switch-statements, but don't you worry: this is by design :) Those methods to be implemented are held as simple as possible, but I'll list them here just to be sure:

- `description`: That is the string the user will see in the terminal when prompted what app template he wants to use.
- `brickName`: That is the name of the directory inside the [NEON app library repo][app_library_repo_link] in which the brick lives. This has to be the EXACT SAME as in the app library repo!
- `variables`: If your brick needed variables, this is where you'd declare them. All of them need a name and a prompt and optional default values.

That is ALL YOU HAVE TO CHANGE IN `lib/src/commands/abfahrt/options/app_options.dart`!!! Nothing else!!!

All set? Then it's time to

### Take off

ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

That's all, folks! Don't forget to update the version in `pubspec.yaml` (since it's an addition of a new template, I'd say an increment of the minor release is appropriate) and execute `dart run build_runner build`!
Now push onto your branch and create a new pull request. As soon as this PR has been reviewed, a new release will be published on the `master` branch and the whole NEON team will be able to update to your new version!
